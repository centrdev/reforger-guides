> Written on May 19, 2023

This is the initial news update post.

This site is created from my own notes and a collection of other sources out there regarding making maps / terrains in ARMA Reforger Workbench.

There are a lot of tips and information scattered around on various sources and comments. So im trying to collect as many as i can and put them here for my own easy reference.

I will try to reference and link to the OG author as best as i can.
