# Adding Modded Vehicles

### How to Add Vehicles?

First you should check out the [official article that alt:V created on streaming vehicles](https://docs.altv.mp/gta/articles/tutorials/stream\_vehicles.html). After getting your first vehicle resource setup, it needs to be placed in the correct folder.

The folder where you should place vehicle mods is üìÅ`resources/mods`
