# About Plugins

### What is NOT a Plugin

Let me preface with the following statements.

* A **mod** is not a plugin
* A **resource** from the _alt:V Hub_ is not a plugin.
* A **mlo** is not a plugin.
* A **clothing item** is not a plugin.

::: warning

Anything that you purchase from any other developer that is **not made for Athena** is not a plugin.

You will need more specific instructions from them to support Athena.

### What is a Plugin

A repository with code that you can drag / drop.

A plugin is 100% compatible with the plugin folder structure.

All plugins go into üìÅ`src/core/plugins`
